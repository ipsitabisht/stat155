# Intro to my project

Here is the intro to my project for **STAT 155**. I am currently looking into *what questions* I would like to answer with an existing data set 

# Topics I am interested in 

I am interested in understanding how businesses create personalized results and content for users that match users preferences and behaviors. Music, movies, shows, recipes, etc. can be personalized to each person. I also would like to explore things like filter bubbles and how too much personalization can be detrimental to individuals and people as a whole.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
