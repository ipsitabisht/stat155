# Spotify Music Feature Analysis Project

My project explores the Spotify Track Dataset from Kaggle to understand how different audio features interact with each other to create a genre fingerprint and contribute to the popularity of a song.
 
### Project Break down

-   [Project 1: initial overview of data and research question](./Project_1/Project1.md)

-   [Project 2: EDA on dataset and investigating which features are important for the model](./Project_2/README.md)

-   [Project 3: Model analysis](./Project_3/README.md)

-   [Project 4: Monte Carlo Simulation: Experimenting with different proportions of classes within dataset](./Project_4/README.md)


### Environment

OS: macOS 14.6\n
Python: 3.11.11\n

Python virtual environment containing data/machine learning libraries included. To activate: \n
1. In the main directory execute this command in terminal: \n
```source venv/bin/activate```

### Steps to reproduce each project:

1. ensure proper packages are installed using virtual environemnt 
2. run the qmd file
